                <h2>What is Contex API</h2>
                <p>The React Context API is a process for making a React app to efficiently produce global variables that is able to pass around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent component to child component to parent component, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux. Context API is one of the best new features added in version 16.3 of React that allows one to share state across the entire app or part of it lightly and with ease. React.createContext() is very much needed and all you need. It returns receiver and provider just like a consumer and a provider. Generally, Provider is a component that as it's names commonly suggests provides the state to its children this auto-suggestion makes you effective as a developer.</p>
